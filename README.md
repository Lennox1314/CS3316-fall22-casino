# CS3316-fall22-casino
Casino class in python for CS3316 Team projects

Your team will clone the repo below and create a casino game as a class within the main casino file. Each team will have a different game to create. Each team will create a branch off of main with the following naming convention: "feature/<team number>-<casino game name>" The point of this project is not to test your coding or problem solving skills, but to give you practice working on a large scale project with many developers. You'll have to deal with conflicts.

Your casino game should be its own class, with all the relevant functions within that class. There should thus be one class for each team/game. You'll notice that the file is pretty blank at the beginning. That is because I will be adding stuff to the file as the week goes on. I am doing this on purpose, you will need to rebase and catch your branch up periodically and adapt to the changes that I make. I will NOT make changes over the weekend or on Monday.

Part 1:

Pull down the code, clone the repo, create your function, deal with conflicts, and make a pull request.

Part 2:

Deal with conflicts, review the pull request of another team, complete your merge.

Each team has a specific game to code up. You can use github, tutorials, etc. Just make sure your function works if a user runs your program.

Remember, you cannot use late days on a project.

It's up to you how the player will play, but it just needs to be as simple as can be. The above are just suggested tutorials, you can use whatever you want and find on the internet.
